## Inspiration
**JobHere** is here to help job applicants and employers meet. Glassdoor and LinkedIn currently available are difficult to navigate, and the application process can be time-consuming and confusing. So, we are here to simplify the job search process for candidates.
And, employers will find the best candidates for their team

## What it does
This app gives the job applicant the probability of being selected to the job they are applying to. Similarly, the employer can build a good job description that lists out the skills they are looking for in a candidate.
 
## How we built it
We used the Cohere API, Python, Figma, Google Colab, and Anvil API to build the prototype. The resume of the job applicant gets summarized and then, skills are extracted and the same is done for the job description, which then is compared to get the probability of getting selected after applying to the job.
A job description is constructed from the skills the employer wants their team to possess

## Challenges we ran into
Too many to count, but here are a few that stand out:
* The summarizer and extractor need more training on the job descriptions that we were having
* No universal format of the resume
* Meeting people after the pandemic

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Ideating and building the prototype within a short span of time was challenging and rewarding
* Learning to use the Cohere API was tricky but we did a great job there

## What we learned
* Networking and learning from other hackers were great
* Breaking our problem statement into smaller chunks and attacking them

## What's next for JobHere
* Various resume formats to be trained with
* The parameters and the model itself needs hyperparameter tuning
